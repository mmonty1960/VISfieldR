# VISfieldR
VISfieldR is the rotational variant of the VISfield method, designed for the evaluation of the intercept-factor of parabolic-trough modules from a series of images captured from the same point of view.
This viewpoint is situated on the plane that intersects the module's rotation axes and contains an horizontal line.
In this rotational version, the image sequence is obtained as the module rotates in such a way that the image of the receiver tube scan the parabolic surface from one rim to the other.
